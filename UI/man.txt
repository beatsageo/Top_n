NAME

findGenre – find the genre of a music audio clip

SYNOPSIS

findGenre [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION

Finds the genre of a music audio clip or folder, provided by the inputPath option, outputting the results of the analysis to standard output (unless the user pipes that into a file) in the form of comma-separated genre names and confidence values, like this:
    audioClipOneNoExt, classical, 0.8, jazz, 0.6, rock, 0.2, pony, 0.02
    audioClipTwoNoExt, rock 0.99, jazz, 0.12, pony. 0.1, classical, 0.007
If no inputPath is provided, the command does nothing, unless another option overrides it. If non-music files are in the folder pointed to by inputPath, they are ignored.

CLI Options:
    -i PATH, --inputPath PATH   Take in audio clips from the folder pointed to by PATH. If PATH points to a single file, then intake only that single file.
    -b, --best-genres GENRES    Restricts the output to no more than GENRES possible genres. This is a maximum and is therefore meaningless if the limit is set sufficiently high. If not included, the model will provide confidence values for all genres.
    -v, --version               Output version information, including an accuracy rating of the current model, and exits. This accuracy metric is the sum of the model’s confidence in its best pick for correctly identified songs, minus the sum of the model’s confidence in its best pick for incorrectly identified songs, all divided by the total number of songs tested.
    -h, --help                  Output this man page, and exit.

The GENRES argument is an unsigned integer.

Exit Status:
    0 if OK,
    1 if there are errors in the CNN, output may be unreliable,
    2 if there are errors in the CNN, no data is output,
    3 if some audio clip not found or read, results likely incomplete,
    4 if there are command errors (ie invalid command line arguments)

EXAMPLES
    findGenre –b=2 ./ > foo.txt
        Attempts to read each file as the audio file type indicated by its extension (.mp4, .mp3, .wav...). The files that can be read are processed by the model, and the output strings are dumped into foo.txt, in the specified format, but with no more than two genre confidence values per file.
    findGenre ./R\ U\ L\ E\ T\ H\ E\ W\ O\ R\ L\ D\ (Gulf\ War\ edit).mp4
        Reads the file R U L E T H E W O R L D (Gulf War edit).mp4 from the current directory and outputs to the terminal the model’s confidence values for all genres.
